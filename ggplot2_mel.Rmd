# Visualizing: `ggplot2` {#ggplot2}

Visualizing data is the best way to understand, check, and describe data.  

## Why ggplot2?

This tutorial focuses exclusively on data visualization using ggplot2 because this package:

* provides a coherent language for visualizing data (vs. the original 'plot' function, which developed in an ad-hoc way)
* makes many tasks easier, such as: visualizing a third (z) variable; saving a plot; automating plotting and formatting tasks
* creates beautiful plots and is flexible

## Install our first package: `tidyverse`

Packages are bundles of functions, along with help pages and other goodies that make them easier for others to use, (ie. vignettes). 

So far we've been using packages that are already included in *base R*. These can be considered *out-of-the-box* packages and include things such as `sum` and `mean`. You can also download and install packages created by the vast and growing R user community. The most traditional place to download packages is from [CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/). This is where you went to download R originally, and will go again to look for updates. You can also install packages directly from GitHub, which we'll do tomorrow.

You don't need to go to CRAN's website to install packages, we can do it from within R with the command `install.packages("package-name-in-quotes")`.

We are going to be using the package `ggplot2`, which is actually bundled into a huge package called `tidyverse`. We will install `tidyverse` now, and use a few functions from the packages within. Also, check out [tidyverse.org/](https://www.tidyverse.org).

```{r, eval=FALSE, messages=FALSE}
## from CRAN:
install.packages("tidyverse") ## do this once only to install the package on your computer.
```

```{r, messages = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) ## do this every time you restart R and need it 
```

When you do this, it will tell you which packages are inside of `tidyverse` that have also been installed. Note that there are a few name conflicts; it is alerting you that we'll be using two functions from dplyr instead of the built-in stats package.

What's the difference between `install.packages()` and `library()`? Why do you need both? Here's an analogy: 

- `install.packages()` is setting up electricity for your house. Just need to do this once (let's ignore monthly bills). 
- `library()` is turning on the lights. You only turn them on when you need them, otherwise it wouldn't be efficient. And when you quit R, it turns the lights off, but the electricity lines are still there. So when you come back, you'll have to turn them on again with `library()`, but you already have your electricity set up.

You can also install packages by going to the Packages tab in the bottom right pane. You can see the packages that you have installed (listed) and loaded (checkbox). You can also install packages using the install button, or check to see if any of your installed packages have updates available (update button). You can also click on the name of the package to see all the functions inside it — this is a super helpful feature that I use all the time.

## Load data

Copy and paste the code chunk below and read it in to your RStudio to load the five datasets we will use in this section.

```{r load_data}
#National Parks in California
ca <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/ca.csv") 

#Acadia National Park
acadia <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/acadia.csv")

#Southeast US National Parks
se <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/se.csv")

#2016 Visitation for all Pacific West National Parks
visit_16 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/visit_16.csv")

#All Nationally designated sites in Massachusetts
mass <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/mass.csv")
```


## Plotting with **`ggplot2`**

**`ggplot2`** is a plotting package that makes it simple to create complex plots from data in a data frame. It provides a more programmatic interface for specifying what variables to plot, how they are displayed, and general visual properties. Therefore, we only need minimal changes if the underlying data change or if we decide to change from a bar plot to a scatterplot. This helps in creating publication quality plots with minimal amounts of adjustments and tweaking.

ggplot likes data in the 'long' format: i.e., a column for every dimension, and a row for every observation. Well structured data will save you lots of time when making figures with ggplot.

ggplot graphics are built step by step by adding new elements. Adding layers in this fashion allows for extensive flexibility and customization of plots.

## Data

We are going to use a National Park visitation dataset (from the National Park Service at <https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/SSRSReports>). Read in the data using `read_csv` and take a look at the first few rows using `head()` or `View()`.

```{r}
head(ca)
```

This dataframe is already in a *long* format where all rows are an observation and all columns are variables. Among the variables in `ca` are:

1. `region`, US region where park is located.

2. `visitors`, the annual visitation for each `year`


To build a ggplot, we need to:

- use the `ggplot()` function and bind the plot to a specific data frame using the `data` argument

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(data = ca)
```

- add `geoms` -- graphical representation of the data in the plot (points,
      lines, bars). **`ggplot2`** offers many different geoms; we will use some 
      common ones today, including:
      * `geom_point()` for scatter plots, dot plots, etc.
      * `geom_bar()` for bar charts
      * `geom_line()` for trend lines, time-series, etc.  

To add a geom to the plot use `+` operator. Because we have two continuous variables,  
let's use `geom_point()` first and then assign x and y aesthetics (`aes`):

```{r first-ggplot, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(data = ca) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = visitors))
```

Notes:

- Anything you put in the `ggplot()` function can be seen by any geom layers
  that you add (i.e., these are universal plot settings). This includes the x and
  y axis you set up in `aes()`.
- You can also specify aesthetics for a given geom independently of the
  aesthetics defined globally in the `ggplot()` function.
- The `+` sign used to add layers must be placed at the end of each line containing
a layer. If, instead, the `+` sign is added in the line before the other layer,
**`ggplot2`** will not add the new layer and will return an error message.

## Building your plots iteratively

Building plots with ggplot is typically an iterative process. We start by defining the dataset we'll use, lay the axes, and choose a geom:

```{r create-ggplot-object, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(data = ca) +
    geom_point(aes(x = year, y = visitors))
```

This isn't necessarily a useful way to look at the data. We can distinguish each park by added the `color` argument to the `aes`:

```{r color-by-species, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(data = ca) +
    geom_point(aes(x = year, y = visitors, color = park_name))
```

## Customizing plots

Take a look at the [**`ggplot2`** cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf), and think of ways you could improve the plot.

Now, let's capitalize the x and y axis labels and add a main title to the figure. I also like to remove that standard gray background using a different `theme`. Many themes come built into the `ggplot2` package. My preference is `theme_bw()` but once you start typing `theme_` a list of options will pop up. The last thing I'm going to do is remove the legend title.

```{r customize}
ggplot(data = ca) +
    geom_point(aes(x = year, y = visitors, color = park_name)) +
    labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Visitation",
       title = "California National Park Visitation") +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(legend.title=element_blank())
```

## **`ggplot2`** themes

In addition to `theme_bw()`, which changes the plot background to white, **`ggplot2`** comes with several other themes which can be useful to quickly change the look of your visualization.

The [ggthemes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggthemes/vignettes/ggthemes.html) package provides a wide variety of options (including an Excel 2003 theme). The [**`ggplot2`** extensions website](https://www.ggplot2-exts.org) provides a list of packages that extend the capabilities of **`ggplot2`**, including additional themes.

> ### Exercise (10 min)

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# 1.
ggplot(data = se) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = visitors, color = park_name))

# 2. & 3.
ggplot(data = se) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = visitors, color = state)) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Visitation",
       title = "Southeast States National Park Visitation") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 14))
```

> 4. The code is missing a geom to describe how the data should be plotted.

## Faceting

ggplot has a special technique called *faceting* that allows the user to split one plot into multiple plots based on data in the dataset. We will use it to make a plot of park visitation by state:

```{r first-facet, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(data = se) +
    geom_point(aes(x = year, y = visitors)) +
    facet_wrap(~ state)
```

We can now make the faceted plot by splitting further by park using `park_name` (within a single plot):

```{r facet-by-state-and-park, purl=FALSE}
 ggplot(data = se) +
     geom_point(aes(x = year, y = visitors, color = park_name)) +
     facet_wrap(~ state, scales = "free")
```


## Geometric objects (geoms)

A __geom__ is the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent data. People often describe plots by the type of geom that the plot uses. For example, bar charts use bar geoms, line charts use line geoms, boxplots use boxplot geoms, and so on. Scatterplots break the trend; they use the point geom. You can use different geoms to plot the same data. To change the geom in your plot, change the geom function that you add to `ggplot()`. Let's look at a few ways of viewing the distribution of annual visitation (`visitors`) for each park (`park_name`).

```{r}
ggplot(data = se) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(x = park_name, y = visitors, color = park_name), 
              width = 0.1, 
              alpha = 0.4) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") 
        
ggplot(se, aes(x = park_name, y = visitors)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

None of these are great for visualizing data over time. We can use `geom_line()` in the same way we used `geom_point`.

```{r}
ggplot(se, aes(x = year, y = visitors, color = park_name)) +
   geom_line()
```

`ggplot2` provides over 30 geoms, and extension packages provide even more (see <https://www.ggplot2-exts.org> for a sampling). The best way to get a comprehensive overview is the [ggplot2 cheatsheet](http://rstudio.com/cheatsheets). To learn more about any single geom, use help: `?geom_smooth`.

To display multiple geoms in the same plot, add multiple geom functions to `ggplot()`:

`geom_smooth` allows you to view a smoothed mean of data. Here we look at the smooth mean of visitation over time to Acadia National Park:

```{r}
ggplot(data = acadia) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = visitors)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = visitors)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = year, y = visitors)) +
  labs(title = "Acadia National Park Visitation",
       y = "Visitation",
       x = "Year") +
  theme_bw()
```


Notice that this plot contains three geoms in the same graph! Each geom is using the set of mappings in the first line. ggplot2 will treat these mappings as global mappings that apply to each geom in the graph.

If you place mappings in a geom function, ggplot2 will treat them as local mappings for the layer. It will use these mappings to extend or overwrite the global mappings _for that layer only_. This makes it possible to display different aesthetics in different layers.

```{r}
ggplot(data = acadia, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Acadia National Park Visitation",
       y = "Visitation",
       x = "Year") +
  theme_bw()
```

> ### Challenge

> With all of this information in hand, please take another five minutes to either improve one of the plots generated in this exercise or create a beautiful graph of your own. Use the RStudio [**`ggplot2`** cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf) for inspiration.

> Here are some ideas:

> * See if you can change the thickness of the lines or line type (e.g. dashed line).
> * Can you find a way to change the name of the legend? What about its labels?
> * Try using a different color palette (see http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/).


## Bar charts

Next, let's take a look at a bar chart. Bar charts seem simple, but they are interesting because they reveal something subtle about plots. Consider a basic bar chart, as drawn with `geom_bar()`. The following chart displays the total number of parks in each state within the Pacific West region.

```{r}
ggplot(data = visit_16, aes(x = state)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

On the x-axis, the chart displays `state`, a variable from `visit_16`. On the y-axis, it displays count, but count is not a variable in `visit_16`! Where does count come from? Many graphs, like scatterplots, plot the raw values of your dataset. Other graphs, like bar charts, calculate new values to plot:

* bar charts, histograms, and frequency polygons bin your data 
  and then plot bin counts, the number of points that fall in each bin.

* smoothers fit a model to your data and then plot predictions from the
  model.

* boxplots compute a robust summary of the distribution and then display a 
  specially formatted box.

The algorithm used to calculate new values for a graph is called a __stat__, short for statistical transformation.

You can learn which stat a geom uses by inspecting the default value for the `stat` argument. For example, `?geom_bar` shows that the default value for `stat` is "count", which means that `geom_bar()` uses `stat_count()`. `stat_count()` is documented on the same page as `geom_bar()`, and if you scroll down you can find a section called "Computed variables". That describes how it computes two new variables: `count` and `prop`.

ggplot2 provides over 20 stats for you to use. Each stat is a function, so you can get help in the usual way, e.g. `?stat_bin`. To see a complete list of stats, try the ggplot2 cheatsheet.

  
### Position adjustments

There's one more piece of magic associated with bar charts. You can colour a bar chart using either the `color` aesthetic, or, more usefully, `fill`:

```{r}
ggplot(data = visit_16, aes(x = state, y = visitors, fill = park_name)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

The stacking is performed automatically by the __position adjustment__ specified by the `position` argument. If you don't want a stacked bar chart, you can use `"dodge"`.


*   `position = "dodge"` places overlapping objects directly _beside_ one 
    another. This makes it easier to compare individual values.


```{r}
ggplot(data = visit_16, aes(x = state, y = visitors, fill = park_name)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge")
```

##### Answers (no peeking!)

```{r}
#how many of each types of parks are in Massachusetts?
ggplot(data = mass) + 
      geom_bar(aes(x = type, fill = park_name)) +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 7))
```

## Arranging and exporting plots

After creating your plot, you can save it to a file in your favorite format. The Export tab in the **Plot** pane in RStudio will save your plots at low resolution, which will not be accepted by many journals and will not scale well for posters. 

Instead, use the `ggsave()` function, which allows you easily change the dimension and resolution of your plot by adjusting the appropriate arguments (`width`, `height` and `dpi`):

```{r ggsave-example, purl=FALSE}
my_plot <- ggplot(data = mass) + 
      geom_bar(aes(x = type, fill = park_name)) +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 7))

ggsave("name_of_file.png", my_plot, width = 15, height = 10)
```

Note: The parameters `width` and `height` also determine the font size in the saved plot.

## Bonus

So as you can see, `ggplot2` is a fantastic package for visualizing data. But there are some additional packages that let you make plots interactive. `plotly`, `gganimate`.

```{r}
#install.packages("plotly")
library(plotly)

ggplotly(my_plot)
```

```{r}

acad_vis <- ggplot(data = acadia, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Acadia National Park Visitation",
       y = "Visitation",
       x = "Year") +
  theme_bw()

ggplotly(acad_vis)

```
